{"name":"ReinProject.org","tagline":"Decentralized professional services market","body":"### The Mission\r\nBuild a decentralized platform and protocol for professional services.\r\n\r\n### Why Rein?  \r\nRein means having the freedom to turn your time into honest digital money and vice-versa. It means being able to build teams without any uninvited members telling you what you can and cannot do. Since, even people living under economic censorship should be able to make a living so Rein will be fully compatible with Tor and other privacy-enhancing technologies. We need identities in the system to be able to estimate trust but there will never be a requirement to link your Rein identity with your offline one.\r\n\r\n### Applications: \r\n * A decentralized labor market that combines human judgement with individual accountability through cryptographic signatures.\r\n * Currency hedging, volatility protection - As long as enough funds are locked up to fulfill the value of the job, signers can easily return excess funds to a job's creator. For example, letâ€™s say a job fee is set at $5k split between a front end dev and back end admin. Guarding against a 20% currency move means putting $6k in Bitcoin in escrow. If the value of escrowed funds drops, the workers would be right to demand more funds be placed in escrow to continue work. No action is required if the opposite happens.\r\n * Milestones - Escrowed funds could be paid out in multiple payments based on reaching milestones in the project. The people in the project have to work together to send the payments and are accountable since their actions are recorded cryptographically.\r\n * Subcontracting. Funds could be broken out and used to create and fund other jobs with completely different mediator/worker/milestone combinations.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
